# cinemaTicketReservation

A simple cinema ticket reservation system web application.
It consists of a container div that contains multiple rows of seats, each represented by a div with the class "seat." A few seats are already marked as "reserved" using the "reserved" class.

The web application also has a drop-down list of movies and some information about the selected seats and the total amount to be paid for the selected seats.

The JavaScript code adds an event listener to the container div, which listens for a click event on the seats. If a seat is clicked, its class is toggled between "seat" and "seat selected." The code also adds an event listener to the movie drop-down list to update the total amount when the selected movie is changed.

Overall, the web application is a basic implementation of a cinema ticket reservation system, allowing users to select seats and view the total cost. However, it is not complete and may require additional functionality to make it a fully functional ticket reservation system.
